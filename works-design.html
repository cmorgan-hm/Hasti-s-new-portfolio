          <small>printed advertisment - Tarjoman Magazine - Nov 2021</small>
          <p>
            This poster, was designed to be published in a magazine for
            commercial purposes. However, the identity of the magazine demanded
            that I focus on the artistic qualities of the poster as well. In
            other words, this poster had to be more of an artwork than just an
            advertisement.

          <h3>The Iceberg</h3>
          <small>poster competition - Sep 2020 </small>
          <p>
            In the poster I designed, the heart floats like an iceberg the bulk
            of which is hidden under the water surface. Such is also the case
            with the tyrannical practice of live organ harvesting; people only
            see the tip of an iceberg and many are not aware of the full extent
            of the disaster caused by illegal harvesting in China and that’s why
            we should raise awareness around this subject.

          <small>printed advertisment - Andishe Pouya Magazine - Dec 2021, Feb 2022</small>
          <p>
            In this project I wanted to simulate the offline learning atmosphere
            of Khonyagar; so, by merging the guitar’s and setar’s (Iranian music
            instrument) necks’ and the progress bar of a video, I was able to
            depict that atmosphere. I wanted to show the variety of our
            educational field by using an electronic instrument and a
            traditional one.

            <h3>How Does Falling in Love Feel Like</h3>
            <small>personal project - Jan 2021</small>
            <p>In this artwork I tried to illustrate how I felt about love at the moment. I was fresh out of a break-up and I felt wounded and heartbroken. I pictured my feelings in this artwork. To me, love was like a beautiful flower growing inside my chest, running its roots deep inside my heart. However, with roots delving deeper and deeper came an agony which grew unbearable over time.
